The `scary-cookie` element can be used to set and read cookies.
You should have one `scary-cookie` element per cookie you want to use,
defined by its `name` property.
You can then read the `value` of the cookie, or save the cookie by setting
the `value` attribute or explicitely calling the `save` method.

##### Example
    <scary-cookie name="mycookie"></scary-cookie>
